# Simple Dependency Injection For Unity

A Unity dependency injection container for managing bindings, resolving, and injecting dependencies..

## Installation

This library is distributed via Unity's built-in package manager. Required Unity 2018.3 or later.

```
https://github.com/UmairSaifullah01/SimpleDI-Unity.git

```

### Unity Package

- Open Unity project
- Download and run .unitypackage file from the latest release

## Usage

![SimpleDI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UmairSaifullah01/Images/master/SimpleDI.jpg)

## Example

Create a installer class and add binding to container

```csharp
public class WeaponInstaller : Installer
    {

    	protected override void InstallBindings()
    	{
    		// Bind the IWeapon interface to the Sword implementation
            // Bind the IWeapon interface to the Gun implementation
    		 _container.Bind<IWeapon, Sword>();
    		 _container.Bind<IWeapon, Gun>();

    	}

    }
```

Use Inject PropertyAttribute to mark field that should inject in class

```csharp
    public class Player
    {

    	[Inject] public IWeapon[] _weapons;

    	public void Attack()
    	{
    		_weapons[0].Attack();
    		_weapons[1].Attack();
    	}

    }

```

Use Installer to install all bindings to inject marked fields

```csharp
    var installer = new WeaponInstaller();
    var player    = new Player();
    installer.Install(player);
    player.Attack(); // Output Weapon1 Attack, Weapon2 Attack
```

## Extension Methods

SimpleDI now provides convenient extension methods for any object to work with dependencies:

```csharp
// Get a dependency
var service = this.GetDependency<IMyService>();

// Get a specific implementation
var specificService = this.GetDependency<IMyService>(typeof(MySpecificService));

// Bind a dependency
this.BindDependency<IMyService, MyService>();

// Bind with custom lifetime
this.BindDependency<IMyService, MyService>(Lifetime.Singleton);

// Bind with custom factory
this.BindDependency<IMyService, MyService>(() => new MyService(), Lifetime.Transient);

// Inject dependencies
var myObject = new MyClass().InjectDependencies();

// Bind a singleton instance
this.BindSingleton<IMyService>(new MyService());

// Bind a scoped instance
this.BindScoped<IMyService>(new MyService());
```

## Features

- Binding Interfaces: Allows binding interfaces to specific implementations with optional factory methods and singleton settings.
- Dependency Resolution: Resolves instances of dependencies, supporting both singleton and non-singleton instances.
- Injection: Injects dependencies into fields marked with the [Inject] attribute.
- Multiple Implementations: Supports resolving specific implementations of an interface.
- Singleton Management: Manages singleton instances to ensure only one instance is created and reused.
- Extension Methods: Provides convenient extension methods for any object to work with dependencies.
- Scoped Dependencies: Supports scoped lifetime for dependencies that should be shared within a specific scope.
